## Session 1: Lost in the Forest

### Defining High Energy Physics (HEP)
HEP involves studying fundamental particles and forces, drawing data from various sources and experiments.
### Key Sources and Facilities in HEP: 
HEP phenomena are explored using multiple methods and locations, including:
- Accelerators and Colliders: A notable example is the LHC (Large Hadron Collider).
- Reactors : An example mentioned is KamLand. Beam Dump experiments.
- Astroparticles originating from sources such as the Sun and Cosmic Rays.
- Specific related projects mentioned include Fermi LAT, Super-K, and Borexino.
- Observations related to the Earth.
- Cosmology:Planck-Gravitational Waves-LIGO-Virgo.
